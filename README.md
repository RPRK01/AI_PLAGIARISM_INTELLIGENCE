# # AI-Driven Plagiarism Intelligence for Assignments

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects plagiarism and AI-generated writing in academic assignments using **IBM Watsonx.ai Open Prompt Lab**.  
It works with or without an unauthorized reference text and produces a clear integrity report without requiring coding.

## 📝 Problem Statement
**Problem:**  
Academic institutions face challenges detecting advanced plagiarism, especially AI-assisted paraphrasing from unauthorized sources.  
Existing tools often miss AI-generated writing styles and nuanced rewording.

**Solution:**  
An AI-powered plagiarism detection system built entirely in **IBM Watsonx.ai Open Prompt Lab** that:
- Identifies **Direct Copy**, **Paraphrased Copy**, and **Original Work**.
- Detects **AI-generated** and **AI-paraphrased** content based on style and tone.
- Provides clear integrity reports in a no-code environment.

## 🛠 Technology Used
- **IBM Cloud Lite Services** – Free-tier cloud platform for building and testing AI solutions.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – For analyzing, comparing, and classifying text.  
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** – For matching submissions against unauthorized reference sources.  
- **IBM Granite Model 3.8 Instruct** – Foundation model for plagiarism detection and AI-writing style analysis.  

## ☁ IBM Cloud Services Used
- **IBM Cloud Watsonx.ai Studio** – Workspace for designing and testing plagiarism detection prompts.  
- **IBM Cloud Watsonx.ai Runtime** – Executes foundation models and delivers structured output.  
- **IBM Cloud Agent Lab** – Builds and manages AI agents for automated plagiarism checks.  
- **IBM Granite Foundation Model** – Core LLM for plagiarism classification and AI-writing style detection.  

## 🌟 Wow Factors & Unique Features
- **Dual Detection:** Identifies plagiarism and AI-generated writing style in one process.  
- **Reference Optional:** Works with or without an unauthorized source text.  
- **AI-Paraphrase Recognition:** Detects AI-assisted rewording of stolen content.  
- **Instructor Feedback:** Generates short, ready-to-use comments for educators.  
- **Clear Integrity Reports:** Shows plagiarism type, AI detection, AI copy type, reason, and instructor note in one format.  

## 👥 End Users
